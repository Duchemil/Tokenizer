# Tokenizer
Create your own token on the blockchain

CoinToutPete42 (CTP42) is a custom ERC-20 token developed and deployed on the Sepolia Ethereum Testnet to avoid real costs.
The project showcases the complete workflow of creating a fungible token using Solidity and deploying it via Remix IDE, without risking real cryptocurrencies.

What are tokens : 
A fungible token is a digital asset where each unit is identical and interchangeable with another of the same type.
Just like currency, one token has the same value and functionality as any other token of that contract.
ERC-20 tokens are the most common example of fungible tokens on Ethereum.

What is the blockchain : 
A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital record of transactions across multiple computers.
Once data is added to the chain, it is secured by cryptography and cannot be easily altered, ensuring transparency and trust without a central authority.
